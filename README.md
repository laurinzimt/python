# A Whirlwind Tour of Python

These notebooks contain the code behind Jake VanderPlas O'Reilly report,
[*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp) (free [100-page pdf](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf)).

*A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential
components of the Python language for researchers and developers who are
already familiar with programming in another language.

The material is particularly aimed at those who wish to use Python for data 
science and/or scientific programming, and in this capacity serves as an
introduction to
[*The Python Data Science Handbook*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) (also
with notebooks [on github](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)).

This material was written and tested using **Python 3.5**.
